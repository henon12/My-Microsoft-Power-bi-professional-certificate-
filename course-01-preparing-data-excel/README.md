# Module Summary: Preparing Data for Analysis with Microsoft Excel

I have reached the end of the third week in this course on preparing data for analysis with Microsoft Excel. This week, I explored how to use functions to prepare data for analysis in Excel. Here is a recap of what I learned in this week‚Äôs lessons.


I now have a stronger grasp of several foundational concepts for understanding data analysis. These include:

- The fundamentals of working with data in Microsoft Excel
- Creating and using formulas and functions
- Preparing and pairing data for analysis using functions

Now, I'm ready to apply my knowledge in the exercise and the final course assessment.



## üóÇÔ∏è Week 1: Introduction to Microsoft Excel

### What I Learned:

- **Data Entry & Formatting**: I learned how to enter and format data, manage worksheets, read large blocks of data, and sort and filter information.
- **Navigation**:
  - I explored the title bar, command tabs, ribbons, name box, and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Data Organization**:
  - I used **sort** (alphanumeric and multilevel) and **filter** to organize and display relevant data.
- **Viewing Tools**:
  - I used **freeze panes**, opened a **new window**, and leveraged the **name box** to make reading large data sets easier.



## ‚ûï Week 2: Functions and Formulas in Excel

### Formulas

- I discovered that a formula is a calculation performed on values in cells (e.g., `=A1+B1`).
- **Static formulas** give fixed results, while **dynamic formulas** update based on referenced values.

### Order of Precedence

- I learned how Excel processes operations based on mathematical hierarchy and how to use **parentheses** to control the order of calculations.

### Cell References

- **Relative references** change when moved or copied.
- **Absolute references** (like `$A$1`) stay constant.

### Built-in Functions

- I used predefined functions like:
  - `SUM`
  - `AVERAGE`
  - `COUNT`
- I created reliable percentage formulas and used tools like:
  - **AutoSum**
  - **Insert Function Wizard**



## üßπ Week 3: Preparing Data for Analysis

### Data Cleaning

- I learned that inconsistent data leads to mistakes.
- I identified and fixed issues like misspellings, extra characters, and incorrect entries.

### Text Functions

- I used:
  - `LEFT`, `MID`, `RIGHT` ‚Äì to extract text from different positions
  - `TRIM` ‚Äì to remove unwanted spaces
  - `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `PROPER` ‚Äì to standardize text case
  - `CONCAT` ‚Äì to combine multiple cell values into one

### Date Functions

- I used:
  - `TODAY()`, `NOW()` ‚Äì to insert current date/time
  - `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()` ‚Äì to break dates into parts

### Logical Functions

- I learned to use:
  - `IF`, `IFS` ‚Äì for condition-based outcomes
  - `AND`, `OR` ‚Äì to combine conditions
  - `SUMIF`, `AVERAGEIF`, `COUNTIF` ‚Äì to perform actions based on criteria
