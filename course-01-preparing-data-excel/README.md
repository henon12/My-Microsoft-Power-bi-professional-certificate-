# Module Summary: Preparing Data for Analysis with Microsoft Excel

I have reached the end of the third week in this course on preparing data for analysis with Microsoft Excel. This week, I explored how to use functions to prepare data for analysis in Excel. Here is a recap of what I learned in this week’s lessons.



## Week 1: Text Functions and Data Cleaning

In the first lesson, I discovered how inconsistent data can affect my analysis and identified common mistakes such as misspellings, unnecessary characters and spaces, and incorrectly placed entries. I learned that these errors negatively impact data analysis, so it’s important to fix them before submitting data for analysis.

I then learned how to use different functions to standardize text data:

- **LEFT, MID, and RIGHT functions**: These return a specific number of characters from the left, middle, or right side of a cell entry. I can use these to split the contents of a column into separate parts by transferring parts of the text to other columns.

- **TRIM function**: This removes extra spaces from text strings except for spaces between words. I use this when I suspect there are random spaces at the beginning or end of an entry, which helps tidy up data before analysis.

- **UPPER, LOWER, and PROPER functions**: These help me standardize the case of text entries to make reports and summaries look neat and professional.

- **CONCAT function**: I use this to combine entries from different cells into a single cell.

In this lesson, I applied my knowledge to help Adventure Works standardize its data for analysis by cleaning up their spreadsheet with formulas that follow best practices. I also completed a knowledge check to test my understanding and explored additional resources to deepen my learning.



## Week 2: Date and Time Functions

In the second week, I learned how to use date and time functions in Excel to generate new data. I explored various ways date and time data can be used, such as for planning, tracking business performance, and displaying key results.

I learned that Excel interprets dates as serial numbers, which allows me to perform calculations like subtracting one date from another.

Some key functions I worked with include:

- **TODAY() and NOW()**: These help me create dynamic formulas that calculate the current date and time.

- **DAY(), MONTH(), YEAR()**: I use these to extract components from a date.

- **DATE()**: This function lets me combine separate day, month, and year values into a single date.

I put my new knowledge into practice by helping Adventure Works plan projects using date and time calculations. For example, in the exercise, I gathered date and time information for one of Adventure Works’ advertising campaigns and generated milestone data.

I then completed a knowledge check and reviewed extra resources to improve my understanding.



## Week 3: Logical Functions (IF and IFS)

In Week 3, I learned about logical functions such as **IF** and **IFS**, which allow me to ask yes/no questions about my data:

- These functions return either true or false.

- Based on the result, Excel can perform different actions.

I learned about **logical operators**, which help define the test I am asking and the values I expect.

The **IF function** requires three things:

- A logical test

- A value to return if true

- A value to return if false

I also learned about **nesting functions**, where I place one function inside another to expand what my formulas can do.

There are two main approaches:

1. **Nested IF functions**: I use multiple IF functions inside one formula to perform several tests, with each additional IF nested inside the previous one’s “value if false” argument.

2. **IFS function**: This function allows me to test multiple conditions one after another and returns the value associated with the first true condition it finds.

I applied these concepts by helping Adventure Works evaluate the financial performance of their sales team using IF and IFS functions. In the exercise, I generated additional information from a customer spreadsheet using these logical functions, making sure to follow best practices.

Finally, I completed a knowledge check and a module quiz to prove my understanding of these topics.

I have now reached the end of this module summary. It’s time to move on to the discussion prompt where I can share what I’ve learned with my peers. Afterwards, I’ll have access to additional resources to deepen my understanding.

Best of luck! I’ll meet again in next week’s lessons.
