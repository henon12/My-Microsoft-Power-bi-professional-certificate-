# üìÖ Excel Date and Time Functions for Windows Users

## üß≠ Introduction

Working with **date and time** in Excel is a common yet powerful skill. This guide covers essential functions to help you perform **date-based calculations**, **time tracking**, **project planning**, and more. Dates and times in Excel are stored as numbers, making them ideal for calculations and automation in your spreadsheets.



## ‚è±Ô∏è How Date and Time Are Tracked in Excel

- Excel stores **dates** as serial numbers starting from **January 1, 1900**.
  - For example, `01/01/1900` is `1`, `01/02/1900` is `2`, and so on.
- **Time** is stored as a fraction of a day.
  - Example: `0.5` equals 12:00 noon.

To enter a date:

```plaintext
MM/DD/YY ‚Üí Example: 08/30/23
```

To enter time:

```plaintext
HH:MM ‚Üí Example: 10:30
```

üìù Note: Date and time values entered directly are static. Use dynamic functions for real-time updates.



## üìÜ Dynamic Date and Time Functions

### ‚úÖ TODAY()

Displays the current system date and updates daily.

```excel
=TODAY()
```

```excel
=NOW()
```

> ü™ü **Windows Tip**: Press `F9` to refresh NOW().

## üìÖ NETWORKDAYS ‚Äì Calculate Working Days

Used to count workdays between two dates, excluding weekends.

```excel
=NETWORKDAYS(A2, B2)
```

- `A2`: Start date  
- `B2`: End date

### üìÜ Including Holidays

```excel
=NETWORKDAYS(A2, B2, H2:H12)
```

- `H2:H12`: List of holiday dates to exclude.

## üß± DATE ‚Äì Combine Year, Month, Day

Used to build a valid date from individual cells.

```excel
=DATE(C2, A2, B2)
```

- `C2`: Year  
- `A2`: Month  
- `B2`: Day

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixing the Excel DATE Function

If your **Year**, **Month**, and **Day** are in separate cells:

- `A2` = Month (e.g., 5)
- `B2` = Day (e.g., 24)
- `C2` = Year (e.g., 2025)

‚úÖ Use this correct formula:
```excel
=DATE(C2, A2, B2)
```

‚õî Incorrect (causes wrong date):
```excel
=DATE(C2, B2, C2)
```

üìÖ Correct Output: `5/24/2025` (May 24, 2025)

## üìä DATEDIF ‚Äì Difference Between Dates

A legacy function to calculate the difference in days, months, or years.

### Difference in Years

```excel
=DATEDIF(B2, C2, "y")
```

- `B2`: Start date  
- `C2`: End date (can be `=TODAY()` for dynamic updates)  
- `"y"`: Unit of time to calculate (`"y"` = years, `"m"` = months, `"d"` = days)

üìå **Important**: You must **type DATEDIF manually**; it's not in the function wizard.
