## 📌 Overview  
This document contains my complete responses to the exercise questions from the "Stakeholder Experience" activity. I have answered all questions using real-world context by applying a shoe sales product example throughout the report. I also created a document version (attached in my GitHub repository) to help visualize and support my answers using tools like **Power BI**.



## ✅ Exercise Questions and Summary of My Answers  

### 1. What is the primary goal of data visualization in the data analysis process?  
To present complex data in a clear, visual format to help stakeholders identify trends, patterns, and insights. For example, I designed a Power BI dashboard to show **daily shoe sales**, filtered by **year** and **location** using **slicers** and **cards** for quick KPIs.



### 2. Briefly define stakeholder experience in the context of data analysis and visualization.  
Stakeholder experience refers to understanding what the users (e.g., executives, marketers, product managers) need and expect from data visuals. In my example, I created dashboards tailored for:
- Executives: Simple, clear visual summaries
- Marketing team: Shoe size sales pattern insights
- Product managers: Product performance vs. gaps



### 3. Explain two reasons why stakeholder experience is important.  
- **Saves time**: Knowing what the user wants avoids wasted work.  
- **Increases clarity & trust**: Targeted visualizations improve decision-making.  
> “If you know your audience well, 90% of your job is already done.”



### 4. List the six steps in the stakeholder experience process.  

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Identifying stakeholders | Know who will use the visualizations |
| 2. Defining goals | Understand what each group needs |
| 3. Choosing visuals | Select the best chart type |
| 4. Designing for experience | Make visuals readable and relevant |
| 5. Adding interactivity | Include slicers, filters, hover-tooltips |
| 6. Testing & iterating | Get feedback and improve visuals |



### 5. How to identify stakeholder goals/preferences?  
- Conduct interviews or surveys  
- Hold regular meetings  
- Review past feedback and reports  
- Collaborate with department heads  

In my case, I assumed stakeholder input to design dashboards showing customer trends and sales gaps.



### 6. One challenge Adio may face  
Balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders (e.g., executives vs. product managers) without overcomplicating the visuals.



### 7. What to consider when choosing visualization types?  
- Data type (e.g., sales trends = line chart)  
- Audience skill level (simple charts for non-technical users)  
- Insight purpose (comparison, distribution, ranking)  

In my shoe sales example, I used **bar charts**, **line charts**, and **maps** for location breakdowns.



### 8. Purpose of interactive visualizations  
They let users explore data by **filtering**, **sorting**, and **drilling down**, helping each stakeholder see only the info they need.  
> Tool used: `Power BI Slicer`



### 9. Which step is Adio engaging in when updating visuals after feedback?  
**Step 6: Testing and iterating** – he improved the report based on stakeholder feedback.



### 10. How stakeholder experience improves outcomes  
Understanding user needs leads to **better data-driven decisions** and **more focused strategies**, which directly support business success.

## ✅ Summary  
This exercise helped me understand how tailoring data visualizations to stakeholder needs (stakeholder experience) leads to better outcomes. I used an example from the **shoe sales domain** to simulate real-world usage and design decisions. The insights were implemented using Power BI tools like **Slicers**, **Cards**, **Maps**, and **Interactive Charts**.
